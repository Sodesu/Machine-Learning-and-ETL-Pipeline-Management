ChatGPT
The log points to an issue with authentication when trying to download a dataset from Kaggle. Specifically, the error message is "Reason: Unauthorized" and a status code of 401 is returned.

This issue typically occurs when you're not properly authenticated with the Kaggle API, which could be due to:

Not having a kaggle.json file in the right location, which should typically be in the ~/.kaggle/ directory. This file should contain your Kaggle username and key, and is used to authenticate with the Kaggle API.
An incorrect or expired API key in your kaggle.json file.
To fix this, you would need to ensure that you're properly authenticated with the Kaggle API by doing the following:

Generate a new API token from the Kaggle website. You can do this by going to your account, scrolling to the API section and clicking on "Create New API Token". This will download a kaggle.json file.

Make sure to place this kaggle.json file in the right location (~/.kaggle/). If you're running this on a server or within a Docker container, you would need to ensure that the file is placed within the correct directory within the environment where the Airflow worker is running.

Make sure the file permissions are secure. You can do this by running the following command: chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json.

If you've done all of this and you're still encountering issues, it could be an issue with the Kaggle API itself or an issue with your account. In that case, you would need to reach out to Kaggle for support.

I have ran the DAG within Apache Airflow successfully up unto the last task: convert_to_parquet.

This is the function within the DAG script for convert_to_parquet

def convert_to_parquet(**kwargs):
    processed_data_fe_path = kwargs['ti'].xcom_pull(key='processed_data_fe_path')
    processed_data_fe = pd.read_csv(processed_data_fe_path, parse_dates=['Date'])
    
    table = pa.Table.from_pandas(processed_data_fe)
    pq.write_table(table, 'C:/Users/knet9/airflow_venv/processed_data_fe.parquet')

and this is the task description for that function:
convert_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='convert_to_parquet',
    python_callable=convert_to_parquet,
    provide_context=True,
    dag=dag,
)
Do you notice anything that could result in this last task not executing successfully?
ChatGPT
From the snippet you've provided, your convert_to_parquet function appears to be correctly defined, and the PythonOperator task is set up correctly as well. However, there are a few things that you can check to diagnose why the task might be failing:

Dependencies: Make sure that pandas, pyarrow and pandas are correctly installed and imported in your Airflow environment. You can add a task at the beginning of your DAG to check the versions of these libraries.

File Access: Check that the processed_data_fe_path returned from the XCom pull exists, is accessible, and contains valid data. Similarly, make sure that the destination path 'C:/Users/knet9/airflow_venv/processed_data_fe.parquet' is accessible and writable.

Column Name 'Date': The function pd.read_csv() is set to parse a column called 'Date'. If this column does not exist in the CSV file, this could cause an error.

Error Logs: Check the logs of the failed task. They are usually available in the Airflow UI, and they should provide more information on the nature of the failure.

Testing: You can test the function outside of Airflow by hardcoding a file path to the processed_data_fe_path variable and seeing if the function runs correctly.

Data Type: Check if there are any columns in the DataFrame that are not supported by Parquet or that need to be explicitly cast to a type that Parquet supports.

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, there could be other factors causing the issue. The error message you're getting would be very useful in narrowing down the potential problems.

Would it be necessary to rename the key to my local direcvtly for example: C:/Users/knet9/airflow_venv/?
ChatGPT
The file path you're using ('C:/Users/knet9/airflow_venv/processed_data_fe.parquet') seems to be fine as it is, assuming it's correctly pointing to the location where you want to save your file and the file does not exist or is not currently open in any other process. However, there are a few things to consider:

Permissions: The directory and the file should have the necessary read and write permissions. Airflow should have permission to write into the C:/Users/knet9/airflow_venv/ directory.

Windows Paths: Since you're using Windows, remember that the backslash is an escape character in Python strings. Although you're using forward slashes (which is good), if you switch to backslashes, remember to escape them (C:\\Users\\knet9\\airflow_venv\\processed_data_fe.parquet) or use raw strings (r'C:\Users\knet9\airflow_venv\processed_data_fe.parquet').

Task Overlaps: If your tasks are running in parallel and multiple tasks are trying to write to the same file, this could cause conflicts. However, based on your code snippet, this doesn't seem to be the case.

Relative Paths: Instead of using absolute paths, you can use relative paths. This would make your code more portable and would avoid issues if you were to move your project to another directory or machine.

If the problem persists after considering these points, I would recommend checking the Airflow logs for more specific information about the error.

The error message in the log is quite clear: ValueError: Missing column provided to 'parse_dates': 'Date'.

This means that the function pd.read_csv(file, parse_dates=['Date']) in the process_dataset function is expecting to find a column named 'Date' in the CSV file it's reading, but it can't find such a column.

Here are a few things you can check:

CSV File Structure: Make sure your CSV file actually has a column named 'Date'. You can open the CSV file and check this manually or programmatically. The column names in a CSV file are usually in the first row.

Column Name Case Sensitivity: Keep in mind that pandas is case sensitive. If your column is named 'date' (all lowercase) or 'DATE' (all uppercase), pandas won't recognize it as 'Date'. Make sure the case matches.

Spelling and Typing Errors: Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces in the column name in your CSV file or your code. For example, 'Date ' (with a trailing space) is different from 'Date'.

Column Existence: If you have control over the creation of the CSV file, make sure the 'Date' column is being correctly populated and not being inadvertently dropped or renamed.

Once you ensure that the 'Date' column is indeed present in your CSV file, your code should work as expected.

The process_dataset function is reading multiple CSV files from the raw_data_files list. Each file is expected to have a 'Date' column because you are specifying parse_dates=['Date'] in your call to pd.read_csv(). The error message you're getting indicates that at least one of these CSV files does not have a 'Date' column.

Here are the options to fix this issue:

Check your CSV files: Ensure that every CSV file you're trying to read in the process_dataset function actually has a column named 'Date'. You can manually check this or write a simple Python script to check it for you. If some files are missing the 'Date' column, you will need to either add it or handle these files differently in your code.

Handle the absence of 'Date' column: If it's expected that some files may not have a 'Date' column, you can modify your code to handle this. Here's a simple way to do it:

python
Copy code
for file in all_files:
    symbol = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(file))[0]
    df = pd.read_csv(file)
    if 'Date' in df.columns:
        df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
    else:
        # handle case where there's no 'Date' column - you need to decide what to do here
        pass
    df['Symbol'] = symbol
    df['Security Name'] = ''  # Add the security name here if available
    df = df[['Symbol', 'Security Name', 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', 'Volume']]
    
    data = data.append(df, ignore_index=True)
With this modification, your function will attempt to convert the 'Date' column to a datetime object only if the column is present.

Refactor the function to work without the 'Date' column: If the 'Date' column is not critical to your application, you can modify your code to work without it.
In general, when working with multiple data sources that might have different structures, it's always a good idea to make your code robust against different column sets and to handle any missing or extra columns gracefully.

Detail for me why this task failed
ChatGPT
The task convert_to_parquet failed due to the error:

pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Unrecognized filesystem type in URI: C:/Users/knet9/airflow_venv/processed_data_fe.parquet

This error is saying that the Python Arrow library (which is used by pq.write_table to write the Parquet file) does not recognize the filesystem in the URI provided.

From the error message, it looks like you are running this code in a Linux environment (as indicated by the /home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ path in the stack trace). However, the URI for the Parquet file you're trying to write (C:/Users/knet9/airflow_venv/processed_data_fe.parquet) appears to be a Windows-style file path.

In a Linux environment, file paths are typically specified in a different format (e.g., /home/user/file.parquet). If you are indeed running this in a Linux environment, you should adjust the file path to match the Linux-style convention.

Moreover, it seems like you're trying to write to a local filesystem directory, but Airflow might be running within a Docker container or a similar environment where the local file path you're trying to write to doesn't exist or isn't accessible. You should make sure that the directory where you're trying to write the file exists and is accessible from within the Airflow environment.

You might need to adjust your code to write the Parquet file to a path that's accessible from within your Airflow environment, and which uses the appropriate file path format for the operating system you're running on.

Also, consider using relative paths if possible, as they're less prone to this kind of platform-specific issue. They allow your code to be more portable across different operating systems.

In conclusion, the task failed because the path provided to write the Parquet file is not recognized by the Arrow library in the environment the code is running on.
